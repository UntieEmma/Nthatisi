<p style="background-color:lightpink;">>The Krispy King Company has its roots dating back to 2001 in Cabu City. Initially, the company operated under the business name Eston Manok and Liempo, specializing in grilled chicken and pork. Over time, recognizing the growing demand and opportunities in the fast-food industry, the company expanded its offerings and ventured into the fast-food chicken business.</p>
    <p style="background-color:lightpink;">>This expansion led to the creation of Krispy King, a brand that has since become synonymous with delicious fried chicken and a variety of other fast-food offerings. Through dedication, innovation, and commitment to quality, Krispy King has grown from its humble beginnings to become a prominent player in the fast-food market.</p>
